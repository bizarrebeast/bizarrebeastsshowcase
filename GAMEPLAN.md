## 📝 Notes

### What Worked Well
- Modular app architecture allows independent development
- Canvas API performs better than expected
- Drag-and-drop UX is intuitive
- LocalStorage sufficient for current needs

### Lessons Learned
- Tailwind v4 compatibility issues → stayed with v3
- Native Canvas API simpler than Konva for our needs
- Sprite flipping logic needs careful attention
- Users want collapsible UI panels

### Technical Debt
- Need to refactor animation loop for better performance
- Should implement proper state management (Redux/Zustand)
- Canvas rendering could use WebGL for complex scenes
- Need comprehensive test coverage
