# BUTQ Showcase Animation System - Comprehensive Development Plan

## Overview
Transform the current animation system into a powerful, modular animation builder with composable blocks, timeline editing, and professional animation tools.

## Phase 1: Animation Building Blocks (Week 1)
### 1.1 Core Action Library
- **Basic Movements**
  - Jump (customizable height, duration)
  - Fall (gravity simulation)
  - Land (with squash effect)
  - Idle (breathing/subtle movement)
  - Walk cycle
  - Run cycle

- **Combat Actions**
  - Attack (strike forward)
  - Hit reaction (knockback)
  - Block (defensive stance)
  - Dodge (quick sidestep)

- **Special Moves**
  - Flip (360° rotation)
  - Spin (continuous rotation)
  - Roll (forward roll)
  - Bounce (Rex-style)
  - Float (power-up style)

### 1.2 Action Block Interface
```typescript
interface ActionBlock {
  id: string;
  type: ActionType;
  name: string;
  duration: number;
  parameters: {
    height?: number;      // For jumps
    distance?: number;    // For movement
    rotation?: number;    // For spins/flips
    intensity?: number;   // For effects
    easing?: EasingType; // Animation curve
  };
  spriteFrames?: string[]; // Associated sprite IDs
  motionPath?: MotionPath; // Position changes
}
```

### 1.3 Implementation
- Create ActionBlock component with visual preview
- Drag-and-drop from library to sequence
- Inline parameter editing
- Real-time preview of individual blocks

## Phase 2: Composable Sequences (Week 2)
### 2.1 Sequence Builder
- **Visual Block Editor**
  - Drag blocks from library
  - Snap-to-grid placement
  - Connection points between blocks
  - Branch conditions (if enemy near, do X)

- **Block Chaining**
  - Auto-transition between blocks
  - Blend modes (instant, smooth, overlap)
  - Timing adjustments between blocks

### 2.2 Smart Templates
Pre-built combinations:
- **Rex Full Jump**: Crouch → Jump → Flip → Fall → Land → Recovery
- **Cat Stalker**: Hide → Wait → Peek → Pounce → Land
- **Beetle Attack**: Roll → Accelerate → Impact → Bounce back
- **Boss Entry**: Drop from above → Land → Roar → Idle

### 2.3 Custom Preset Creation
- Save custom block combinations
- Name and categorize
- Share/export presets
- Import community presets

## Phase 3: Timeline Editor (Week 3)
### 3.1 Multi-track Timeline
```

## Phase 4: Motion Modifiers (Week 4)
### 4.1 Easing Functions
- Linear

- Bounce
- Elastic
- Back (overshoot)
- Custom curve editor

### 4.2 Motion Effects
- **Speed Control**
  - Slow motion sections
  - Speed ramping
  - Freeze frames
  
- **Physics Simulation**
  - Gravity
  - Momentum
  - Friction
  - Spring physics

### 4.3 Visual Effects
- Motion blur
- After-images/trails
- Particle emissions
- Screen shake triggers

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 5)
### 5.1 Animation Layers
```
Layer Stack:
1. Background effects
2. Shadow layer
3. Main character sprite
4. Weapon/item layer
5. Foreground effects
6. UI indicators
```

### 5.2 Procedural Animation
- Auto-generate walk cycles
- Physics-based secondary motion
- Procedural idle animations
- Dynamic reaction animations

### 5.3 Animation Blending
- Blend between animations
- Layer multiple animations
- Masked animations (upper body only)
- Additive animations

## Phase 6: Professional Tools (Week 6)
### 6.1 Animation Workspace
- Multiple viewport layouts
- Onion skinning
- Motion paths visualization
- Animation curves editor

### 6.2 Export Options
- Sprite sheet generation
- GIF export with optimization
- Video export (MP4, WebM)
- JSON animation data
- Game engine formats

### 6.3 Collaboration Features
- Animation library sharing
- Version control integration
- Comments/annotations
- Real-time collaboration

## Technical Architecture

### Data Structures
```typescript
interface AnimationProject {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  scenes: AnimationScene[];
  library: ActionBlock[];
  assets: AssetLibrary;
}

interface AnimationScene {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  timeline: Timeline;
  layers: AnimationLayer[];
  duration: number;
}

interface Timeline {
  tracks: Track[];
  keyframes: Keyframe[];
  duration: number;
  fps: number;
}
```

## Implementation Priority

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Week 1-2
1. ✅ Basic action blocks (12 blocks: Jump, Fall, Land, Idle, Flip, Spin, Bounce, Float, Roll, Attack, Dodge, Hit)
2. ✅ Drag-and-drop sequence builder with reordering
3. ✅ Inline parameter adjustment (duration, height, distance, rotation, easing)
4. ✅ Real-time preview with animation engine
5. ✅ Smart Templates (Rex Full Jump, Cat Stalker, Beetle Attack, Boss Entry)
6. ✅ Sprite upload and management system
7. ✅ Collapsible panels for workspace management
8. ✅ Visual timeline with playhead
9. ✅ 6 easing functions (linear, easeIn, easeOut, easeInOut, bounce, elastic)

### Enhanced Version - Week 3-4
1. Timeline editor
2. Easing functions
3. Motion paths
4. Smart templates

### Professional Version - Week 5-6
1. Multi-layer system
2. Advanced effects
3. Export options
4. Collaboration tools

## UI/UX Design Principles
1. **Intuitive Drag-and-Drop**: Everything should be draggable
2. **Real-time Preview**: See changes immediately
3. **Context-Sensitive Tools**: Show relevant options
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Pro user efficiency
5. **Responsive Layout**: Adapt to screen size

## Performance Considerations
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth playback
- Implement virtual scrolling for long timelines
- Cache rendered frames
- Use Web Workers for heavy computations
- Optimize sprite atlas usage

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for animation calculations
2. Integration tests for block chaining
3. Performance benchmarks
4. Cross-browser compatibility
5. Mobile responsiveness

## Success Metrics
- Create complex animation in < 5 minutes
- 60 FPS playback performance
- < 100ms response time for interactions
- Export quality comparable to professional tools
- User satisfaction > 90%

## Next Steps
1. Set up new AnimationStudio component structure
2. Implement basic action blocks
3. Create drag-and-drop sequence builder
4. Add parameter editing UI
5. Implement preview system

This plan provides a clear roadmap to transform the current animation system into a professional-grade animation studio within the BUTQ Showcase tool.
